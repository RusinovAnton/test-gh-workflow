# Test project

This test project been created to proof the concept of git flow using squash merge strategy using `master` branch for production and `develop` for staging.

- `master` - has linear commits history of squashed release PRs
- `develop` - has linear commits history of squashed feature PRs
- `feature-<n>` - has commits history of the feature development process

## Testing second merge develop > master
